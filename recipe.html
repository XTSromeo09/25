        this theory, claiming the origin of feijoada comes from the European settlers </u></strong>. Beans became one of their main foods thanks to its low-maintenance and lost-cost production. They added in cuts of meat

        s and didnâ€™t demand much effort to make. Regardless of the origins, nowadays feijoada is a truly Brazilian dish that is enjoyed and celebrated all across the world.</p>
